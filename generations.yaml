    description: "The Maxus eDeliver 3 (also marketed as the LDV eDeliver 3 in some markets) represents one of the first purpose-built electric commercial vans in its segment, rather than being an electrified conversion of an existing diesel model. Designed by the Chinese automotive manufacturer SAIC Motor and sold under their Maxus/LDV brand, it targets the urban delivery and small business market with its compact dimensions and zero-emission capabilities. Available in both van and chassis cab configurations with short and long wheelbase options, it offers versatility for various commercial applications. The exterior features a modern, clean design with a blanked-off grille, LED daytime running lights, and sliding side door. Powered by a front-mounted electric motor producing 122 horsepower and 255 Nm of instant torque, paired with either a 35 kWh or 52.5 kWh battery pack offering a WLTP-rated range of approximately 99 miles or 151 miles respectively. DC fast charging capability allows recharging to 80% in approximately 45 minutes, while a complete charge using a 7kW AC wallbox takes between 5-8 hours depending on battery size. The interior provides a functional workspace with features uncommon in commercial vehicles at this price point, including a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, air conditioning, cruise control, and various storage solutions. The cargo area offers up to 6.3 cubic meters of volume in the long wheelbase version, with a payload capacity of up to 1,020 kg depending on the configuration. Safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and a rear parking camera. Three driving modes (Eco, Normal, and Power) allow drivers to prioritize either range or performance based on their needs. As one of the more affordable purpose-built electric commercial vehicles, the eDeliver 3 targets urban businesses facing increasing low-emission zone restrictions while offering operating cost advantages through reduced fuel and maintenance expenses compared to traditional diesel vans."
